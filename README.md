### Use of the Aylien API

It has you install a node module to run certain commands through, it will simplify the requests we need to make from our node/express backend.You will need to go [here](https://developer.aylien.com/) and follow the instructions to setup the API.

The API has a lot of different endpoints you can take a look at [here](https://docs.aylien.com/textapi/endpoints/#api-endpoints).
